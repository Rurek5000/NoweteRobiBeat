## About
A game created for a birthday present.
A simple story of a man who wanted to compose music but was approached by his short friend. Our hero was entangled in the web of the plot and the ending surprised everyone.

I am responsible for all the graphics (faces) and scenes (background) that were created with ready-made tiles.

The "story line" was also invented by me.

## Technologies
* Phaser 3
* TypeScript
* Tiled (for maps)

## Walkthrough
You can watch my walkthrough on youtube (game is in polish).
